# STRATEGIC WORKFORCE PLANNING
**A primer for newbies**

### What is Strategic Workforce Planning?

We hate to say it, but it depends. I would like to justify this by saying it's like asking what is AI to Sam Altman and then turning around and asking a bodega owner. You're going to get two wildly different answers based on their involvement, size of business, application, etc. For me, it's more than just Buy, Build, Borrow - although now it'll be more like Buy, Build, Borrow, Automate. For me it's about bridging together the business strategy with the workforce strategy to achieve the future goals of the business. 

### Why did I create this? 

Have you be searching the web for tips, tricks, and tutorials on SWP? Are you tired of listening to podcasts where SWP experts speak about the subject in the broadest sense possible? Listen, we get it. The data and insights are propriety. The software and tools are somebody's business. So we never really get a chance to try it in action - unless you want to pay a fee or sign a subscription fee. 

For those who need to see it in action and dynamically change the visuals and data, you've come to the right place. 

### The basics

We're going to the most basic principles of SWP. We're going to start off with Worfkforce Demand and see how it changes based on the perspective of the planner. Then we're going to look at a simple example of Workforce Supply and how there is so much work to be done internally before you start looking at external data sources. Finally, we're going to conclude this primer with a Gap Analysis and how to drive some basic insights.
