# STRATEGIC WORKFORCE PLANNING
A primer for newbies. 

### What is Strategic Workforce Planning?

We hate to say it, but it depends. I would like to justify this by saying it's like asking what is AI to Sam Altman and then turning around and asking a bodega owner. You're going to get two wildly different answers based on their involvement, size of business, application, etc. For me, it's more than just Buy, Build, Borrow - although now it'll be more like Buy, Build, Borrow, Automate. For me it's about bridging together the business strategy with the workforce strategy to achieve the future goals of the business.
