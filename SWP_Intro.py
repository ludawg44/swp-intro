    We're going to keep this Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) primer straightforward and simple. You have to know how to crawl before you can start running. While there are various strategies, frameworks, and models within SWP, we'll begin with the fundamentals. In this primer, weâ€™ll focus on three key topics: Workforce Demand, Workforce Supply, and Gap Analysis. Our goal is that by mastering these foundational concepts, youâ€™ll gain a better understanding of how to effectively implement SWP within your organization.

    Workforce Demand can be viewed from two perspectives. The first takes a high-level approach, incorporating only a few key factors into the calculationâ€”ideal for busy VPs and Directors who need a quick, strategic overview. The second perspective is more detailed, focusing on the demand for each specific position or role within the organization, which is often used by managers or frontline teams. In this section, weâ€™ll demonstrate both approaches to help you understand how Workforce Demand can be analyzed at different levels.

    One has to be critical - yet unbiased - when evaluating the bench strength of your existing employees against the strategic needs of the business. 
    \nAs you dig deeper, you will find it helpful to have your talent strategy near you to rank what gaps need to be addressed.
    For each area of your talent strategy, consider how well you're prepared to handle the future state and how much impact it will have on your organization or team. 
    If you're blanking out on external factors that could effect your talent strategy, I wrote a couple down to get the ball rolling:  \n
    - Global talent challenges
    - Aging population in the labor market
    - Competition for talent will intensify
