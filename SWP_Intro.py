    We're going to keep this Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) primer relatively straightforward and simple.
    You have to know how to crawl before you start running.
    We understand there are various strategies, frameworks, and models used in SWP, but we're going to start with the fundamentals. 
    There are three topics we're going to cover in this primer. 
    The first one is Workforce Demand, followed by Workforce Supply, and lastly Gap Analysis. 
    It is our hope that with these three fundamental concepts you will achieve a better understanding of how to implement SWP within your organization.

    Workforce Demand can be thought of having two views of the workforce you or your company desires. One incorporates a high-level perspective with a minimal amount of factors incorporated into the calculation (think really busy VPs and Director levels folks).
    The second is an aggregate of the demand for each position or role within an organization or team (think managers or boots on the ground). We're going to demonstrate both perspective in this section.
